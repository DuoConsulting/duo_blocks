# Developing with duo_blocks

<span style="color:red">(Work in progress)</span>

## Miscellaneous Notes:

The duo_block_stats custom block has an Icon field. It assumes that you are using the Duo Foundation theme or that you have FontAwesome enabled in your custom theme.

## How to Develop Locally:

### To Update Existing Block Types
